Welcome to Symon Jory Stevens-Guille's academic homepage!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University. I primarily work on topics in computational and mathematical linguistics, especially as they relate to theoretical syntax and semantics. My current research centers on theoretical models of semantic parsing, particularly with respect to anaphora, ellipsis, and discourse coherence. Much of my work is within the so-called parsing-as-deduction tradition, and so models linguistic competence with contemporary varieties of type-logical grammar. More practically, I've got a big moral commitment to the pursuit of ethical NLP. Of course, I care about languages on their own terms as much as I care about their social, psychological, computational, or mathematical properties. I'm especially fascinated by Bantu languages and dialects of French, particularly those of Acadia. 

Outside of linguistics proper, I maintain research interests in substructural logic, modern type theory, and formal language theory.
