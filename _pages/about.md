Greetings, friendo!

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the Ohio State University. I primarily work on topics in computational and mathematical linguistics, especially as they relate to theoretical syntax and semantics. My current research centers on theoretical models of semantic parsing, particularly with respect to anaphora, ellipsis, and discourse coherence. Much of my work is within the so-called parsing-as-deduction tradition, and so models linguistic competence with contemporary varieties of type-logical grammar. More practically, I've got a big moral commitment to the pursuit of ethical NLP. Of course, I care about languages on their own terms as much as I care about their social, psychological, computational, or mathematical properties. I'm especially fascinated by Bantu languages and dialects of French, particularly those of Acadia. 

Outside of linguistics proper, I maintain research interests in substructural logic, modern type theory, and formal language theory. 

In my other life, I also write code for money. In practice, this looks like Python projects for nlp and web development. But I've got a deep and abiding love for logic programming, particularly Prolog, as well as a developing passion for functional programming. Solicitations related to software development are welcome.

In my other other life, I write and write about poems. 

You won't find me on social media, but I can be reached for all matters professional at stevensguille.1 [at] buckeyemail.osu.edu
